# My Ico Project
A project in which I created a web page from which is possible to buy the Ico I created, MyInuCoin (MIC).

## Setup

⚠️ NodeJs recommended to **v16**, otherwise you could get errors ⚠️

```
npm i --force
npm run start
```

### How it works
- Install and configure Metamask on your browser
  - Configure BSC Test network
    - Url RPC: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
    - Chain ID: 97
    - Symbol: BNB
    - Url block explorer: https://testnet.bscscan.com
  - Then make sure to transfer some BNB to your address on test network
    - You could use: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart
  - Import MyInuCoin (MIC) to your wallet
    - token address: 0xC41CcDF9e033EAd1F894455A9549Db6253DADA35
- Click on **Connect** button (on top right)
- Once the wallet is connected you can buy token
- Insert a value in BNB to see the quantity of MIC you can buy
- Click on **Buy** and proceed on Metamask to confirm the transaction
- Then you'll see the transaction details on Metamask, and the MIC incremented
